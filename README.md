# Singel-Cell RNA sequencing anaysis pipeline
Overview
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique used to analyze the gene expression profiles of individual cells. This method provides insights into the cellular heterogeneity within a population, allowing researchers to identify rare cell types and understand the function of individual cells in their microenvironment.
This repository contains an R-based pipeline for preprocessing, normalization, clustering, and differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using the Seurat package. The workflow covers:

Loading raw data from different sources, including NCBI and 10X Genomics format

Creating Seurat objects and merging multiple samples

Normalization, scaling, and PCA

Clustering and visualization using UMAP

Differential gene expression analysis between control and disease samples

Visualization of marker genes and differentially expressed genes

Prerequisites

Ensure that you have R installed along with the necessary packages. You can install them using:
install.packages("Seurat")
install.packages("Matrix")
install.packages("EnhancedVolcano")
